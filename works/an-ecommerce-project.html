			<h1>an E-Commerce Project</h1>

				<p>The start-up where I applied my frontend skills had taken on a fairly large project. Our client, a Cakes and
					Bakery business, already had a website and wanted to add more functionality than just information and links to
					buy product.</p>
				<p>Our team then envisioned a solution: building an e-commerce platform. Visitors can add products to
					their cart, checkout, and make payments, just like on a typical e-commerce website. That's why I consider this
					was a big project.</p>
				<p>After discussing the list of features, our friend, the UI/UX designer, created a mockup or hi-fi design. "It
					can't be done with simple technology; a PHP web application with CodeIgniter seems difficult to split.
					Something new is needed." I thought. Although, thinking back now, it could actually work, as many e-commerce
					sites are monoliths. Suddenly, I remembered Vue, a JavaScript framework that seems suitable for this project.
					I've heard it can create many small components, which is interesting.</p>
				<p>I did some research on YouTube to find out what the backend should be like if we use Vue. I had heard about
					Laravel + Vue but didn't know much about it. Besides, my backend friend usually uses CodeIgniter 4, so I
					ignored it. I found a tutorial on VueJS &amp; CodeIgniter 4, which is a perfect fit.</p>
				<p>"It turns out that the frontend can indeed be separated from the backend, with data exchange via APIs. Tokens
					are needed for security; this is completely new to me!"</p>
				<p>Boldly, I suggested to my friend that we try something new for this project. I explained the idea, and since
					my colleague had just heard the term REST API, I needed to provide that tutorial.</p>
				<p>The two of us continued learning: I delved deeper into Vue, while my friend explored how APIs work, since the
					framework they usually used sent HTML to the browser.</p>
				<p>I was assisted by two other programmers. They created components so I didn't need to make everything. I
					converted those components into Vue Single-File Components. Implementing global state management using Vuex.
					Added Navigation Guard to protect admin resource. Many pages to build.</p>

				<h3>The Tech Stack</h3>
				<p>This website used the following tech stack:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Frontend: <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue Ecosystem</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwindcss</a></li>
					<li>Backend: CodeIgniter 4, MySQL</li>
					<li>API Architecture: REST</li>
					<li>Payment Gateway: Midtrans, Xendit</li>
					<li>Third-party: Google Maps JavaScript, Places, Geocoding &amp; Distance Matrix API</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Tailwindcss can helped us to do styling faster, highly customizable and it's also suitable with Vue.</p>

				<h3>Valuable Lessons</h3>
				<p>I will start with the problem.</p>
				<p>This project did not meet the client's expectations.<br />It was a hard blow for me as a developer.</p>
				<p>There's just one thing I can share: I found out midway through development that SPAs were not really meant
					for SEO. I needed to do pre-rendering or implement SSG/SSR, and Nuxt was a shorter path if we want to migrate.
					SEO was an important aspect that this website should have had.</p>
				<p>Lessons I got from the project are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Good developers are willing to sacrifice their time early and as wisely as possible.<br />I did not give
						my best effort.</li>
					<li>Telling REST API to my friend, was a relaxing experience. I believe it will help him in his web
						development
						journey out there.</li>
					<li>Requirements may change, but asking early feedback from the client is highly recommended. Pay attention to
						both
						functional and non-functional requirements. Does the technology support these? Later on, it could be like my
						case where it was not SEO friendly.</li>
				</ul>
