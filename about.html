				<h2>Indonesian</h2>
				<p>Being a nomad isn't easy, but it's what life has given me. I spent most of my childhood in Balikpapan, Borneo
					island. It was a lively place with beautiful forests and beaches üèñÔ∏è. Now, I live in South Tangerang, on the
					western side of the island of Java. Life here is more urban and fast-paced. Moving around has been
					challenging, but each place has given me unique memories and experiences.</p>

				<p>I really enjoy playing with laptops; this simple reason led me to believe that computer science is the only
					suitable study for me. During my studies, I gained a lot of programming fundamentals, but not so much in-depth
					technical knowledge. I was not paying attention enough, though. Programming is like an ocean I think; you
					never know how large
					it is and where its end is.</p>
				<p>On college, I learned how to sort items using Pascal language, how to create a simple twitter website which
					has tweets so I understand what JSON is, cloned already existing website using PHP, and implement a Data
					Warehouse solution with PostgreSQL. Honestly, I
					did not understand the relationship between each other.</p>
				<p>You may hear about WordPress, Telegram bots, ChatGPT, and E-Commerce, those digital products are developed by
					bunch of programmers.</p>
				<h3>If programming is an ocean üêã<br />where am I?</h3>
				<p>In terms of work, roles or professions (as a programmer) are usually more specific. I have worked as a
					<strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, a role responsible for developing software on the user interface side ‚Äî
					the part you see and interact with, for example, the input box for typing Instagram caption. A contrasting
					role is Backend Developer, which focuses on developing server application to support frontend application,
					such as supplying data from database. Here is another example: if your friend likes your instagram post, that
					like and
					your friend username must be saved in the server so it does not get lost.
				</p>
				<p>For the jack-of-all-trades role, many call it a Fullstack Developer or simply a Software Developer. These
					roles require both of Frontend and Backend skills, superb isn't it?</p>
				<p>There are three types of software: web, mobile, and desktop based application.<br />Their notable difference lies in
					where the
					software is used or installed. As a Frontend Developer, we primarily work on web-based
					software‚Äîapplications that run in a web browser (Google Chrome, Safari...). These can be website or web
					application. My homepage that you are visiting right now is a website, or I like to call it webpage because it
					contains some pages and no other functionality. Importantly, this doesn't exclude the possibility of creating
					applications that can run on
					multiple platforms, especially when there isn't a dedicated developer available for a specific platform,
					usually a
					mobile developer or an application developer.</p>
				<p>Programmer, Developer, and Engineer are similar <em>roles</em>, the latter requires you to plan and design
					the software, it is comprehensive.<br />On the other hand; Programming, Development, and Engineering are the
					<em>process</em> or
					the main task. These terms or jargons may not be 100% agreed upon by everyone, but I hope you get the point.

				<h3>Why I choose to live in Frontend Development Planet?</h3>
				<p>It's a God's plan.</p>
				<p>We never know eh.. we just never knowüòÜ but the reason you may want to hear is...</p>
				<p>It's my personal preference; I feel enthusiastic in learning the concepts, the UX, best practices. I want to spend more years working on anything related to Frontend (FE).</p>
				<p>This specific area of programming is also huge. It connects with other parts of technology outside of client-side things. For example, we usually use tools that run on Node.js, which is a server-side runtime for JavaScript, to make our frontend application production-ready (performant, better compatibility, etc.) when delivered to the web browser. While doing Frontend we will also interact with things that most Backend Developers do. There's a lot of cool frontend technologies out there, and it's going to be fun!</p>
				<p>Anyway, if you want to ask me about this planet or you want to start the journey in frontend development, please let me know, I am happy to hear that!</p>
