				<h2>Indonesian</h2>
				<p>Being a nomad isn't easy, but it's what life has given me. I spent most of my childhood in Balikpapan, Borneo island. It was a lively place with beautiful forests and beaches üèñÔ∏è. Now, I live in South Tangerang, on the western side of the island of Java. Life here is more urban and fast-paced. Moving around has been challenging, but each place has given me unique memories and experiences.</p>

				<p>I really enjoy playing with laptop; this simple reason led me to believe that computer science is the only suitable study for me. During my studies, I gained a lot of programming fundamentals (yeah, that's what this study is about), but not so much in-depth technical knowledge in my case. Programming is like an ocean; you never know where its end is. Yesterday, I learned about data structures using the C++ language, and then I had an exam where I had to create a desktop application using Java. Honestly, I don't understand their relationship with each other.</p>
