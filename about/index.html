          <p>
            Being a nomad isn't easy, but it's what life has given me. I spent
            most of my childhood in Balikpapan, Borneo island. It was a lively
            place with beautiful forest and
            <span class="_nowrap">beach üèñÔ∏è</span>. Now, I live in South
            Tangerang. Life here is more urban and fast-paced. Moving around has
            been challenging, but each place has given me unique memories and
            experiences.

            I really enjoy playing with laptops; this simple reason led me to
            believe that computer science was the only suitable field of study
            for me. During college, I learned a lot of programming fundamentals,
            but not much in-depth technical practice ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt paying enough
            attention, though. Programming is like an ocean; you never know how
            vast it is or where it ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            In college, I studied programming concepts, languages, databases,
            problem-solving, tools, software documentation ‚Äî and, of course,
            building apps.
          </p>
          <h3>Working as a Programmer</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of work, programming roles or professions are usually quite
            specific. I've worked as a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, a
            role responsible for developing software on the user interface side
            ‚Äî the part you see and interact with, such as the input box where
            you type an Instagram caption. A contrasting role is the Backend
            Developer, which focuses on developing the server-side application
            that supports the frontend, such as supplying or storing data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's another example: if your friend likes your Instagram post,
            that ‚Äúlike‚Äù and your friend's username must be saved so that when
            you open Instagram, your post shows your friend's like.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the jack-of-all-trades type of role, many call it a Fullstack
            Developer or Software Developer. These roles require both frontend
            and backend skills ‚Äî pretty cool, isn't it?
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three common types of software: web, mobile, and
            desktop-based applications. I guess you've used them before. Their
            main difference lies in where the software is installed. As a
            frontend developer, we often work on web-based software ‚Äî
            applications that run in a web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, and
            so on). These can be websites or web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            My homepage, the one you're visiting right now, is a website ‚Äî or
            rather, a webpage, since it contains a few pages and doesn't have
            additional functionality. Of course, that doesn't exclude the
            possibility of building applications that can run across multiple
            platforms, especially when there isn't a dedicated developer for a
            specific platform, such as mobile or desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programmer, Developer, and Engineer are similar roles, though the
            last one often involves more planning and software design ‚Äî a more
            comprehensive scope. On the other hand, Programming, Development,
            and Engineering refer to the activities themselves. These terms or
            jargons might not be universally agreed upon, but I hope you get the
            idea. What really matters is their problem-solving ability ‚Äî helping
            humans solve problems through Information Technology.
