            Being a nomad isn't easy, but it's what life has given me. I spent
            most of my childhood in Balikpapan, Borneo island. It was a lively
            place with beautiful forests and beaches üèñÔ∏è. Now, I live in South
            Tangerang. Life here is
            more urban and fast-paced. Moving around has been challenging, but
            each place has given me unique memories and experiences.

            I really enjoy playing with laptops; this simple reason led me to
            believe that computer science is the only suitable study for me.
            During my studies, I gained a lot of programming fundamentals, but
            not so much in-depth technical practice. I was not paying attention
            enough, though. Programming is like an ocean; you never know
            how large it is and where it ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            On college, I learned programming concepts, languages, database, problem solving, tools, software documents and yeah creating an app.
          </p>
          <h3>Working as a Programmer</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of work, roles or professions (as a programmer) are usually
            more specific. I have worked as a
            <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, a role responsible for
            developing software on the user interface side ‚Äî the part you see
            and interact with, for example, the input box for typing Instagram
            caption. A contrasting role is Backend Developer, which focuses on
            developing server application to support frontend application, such
            as supplying or storing data. Here is another example: if your
            friend likes your instagram post, that like and your friend username
            must be saved so when you open your instagram, your post has friend's like.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the jack-of-all-trades role, many call it a Fullstack Developer
            or a Software Developer. These roles require both of Frontend
            and Backend skills, superb isn't it?
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three common types of software: web, mobile, and desktop based
            application.<br />I guess you have used them before. Their notable difference lies in where the
            software is installed. As a Frontend Developer, we often
            work on web-based software‚Äîapplications that run in a web browser
            (Google Chrome, Firefox...). These can be website or web application.
            My homepage that you are visiting right now is a website, or I like
            to call it a webpage because it contains some pages and no other
            functionality. Importantly, this doesn't exclude the possibility of
            creating applications that can run on multiple platforms, especially
            when there isn't a dedicated developer available for a specific
            platform, e.g. mobile developer or application developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programmer, Developer, and Engineer are similar <em>roles</em>, the
            latter requires you to plan and design the software, it is comprehensive. <br />On the other hand; Programming, Development, and
            Engineering are the <em>activity</em>. These terms
            or jargons may not be 100% agreed upon by everyone, but I hope you
            get the point. What really matters is their problem solving skill to help human problems with the use of Information Technology.
