            Being a nomad isn't easy, but it's what life has given me. I spent
            most of my childhood in Balikpapan, Borneo island. It was a lively
            place with beautiful forests and beaches üèñÔ∏è. Now, I live in South
            Tangerang, on the western side of the island of Java. Life here is
            more urban and fast-paced. Moving around has been challenging, but
            each place has given me unique memories and experiences.

            I really enjoy playing with laptops; this simple reason led me to
            believe that computer science is the only suitable study for me.
            During my studies, I gained a lot of programming fundamentals, but
            not so much in-depth technical knowledge. I was not paying attention
            enough, though. Programming is like an ocean I think; you never know
            how large it is and where its end is.
          </p>
          <p>
            On college, I learned how to sort items using Pascal language, how
            to create a simple twitter website which has tweets so I understand
            what JSON is, cloned already existing website using PHP, and
            implement a Data Warehouse solution with PostgreSQL. Honestly, I did
            not understand the relationship between each other.
          </p>

            You may hear about WordPress, Telegram bots, ChatGPT, and
            E-Commerce, those digital products are developed by bunch of
            programmers.
          </p>
          <h3>If programming is an ocean üêã<br />where am I?</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of work, roles or professions (as a programmer) are usually
            more specific. I have worked as a
            <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, a role responsible for
            developing software on the user interface side ‚Äî the part you see
            and interact with, for example, the input box for typing Instagram
            caption. A contrasting role is Backend Developer, which focuses on
            developing server application to support frontend application, such
            as supplying data from database. Here is another example: if your
            friend likes your instagram post, that like and your friend username
            must be saved in the server so it does not get lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the jack-of-all-trades role, many call it a Fullstack Developer
            or simply a Software Developer. These roles require both of Frontend
            and Backend skills, superb isn't it?
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three types of software: web, mobile, and desktop based
            application.<br />Their notable difference lies in where the
            software is used or installed. As a Frontend Developer, we primarily
            work on web-based software‚Äîapplications that run in a web browser
            (Google Chrome, Safari...). These can be website or web application.
            My homepage that you are visiting right now is a website, or I like
            to call it webpage because it contains some pages and no other
            functionality. Importantly, this doesn't exclude the possibility of
            creating applications that can run on multiple platforms, especially
            when there isn't a dedicated developer available for a specific
            platform, usually a mobile developer or an application developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programmer, Developer, and Engineer are similar <em>roles</em>, the
            latter requires you to plan and design the software, it is
            comprehensive.<br />On the other hand; Programming, Development, and
            Engineering are the <em>process</em> or the main task. These terms
            or jargons may not be 100% agreed upon by everyone, but I hope you
            get the point.
